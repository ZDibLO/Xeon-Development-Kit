# Xeon Development Kit
Xeon development kit is toolkit for plugin development in Xeon similiar to forge but you are more like adding stuff rather than modifying current code
# Usage
Using XDK (v1.0) is recommended to be used with wrappers to object instead of calling directly implementations
# How i can get an example wrapper?
In future, before release there will be xStore central repository for plugins where you can upload or download required plugins
# What does plugin?
Plugin is library that can contain some usefull code, configs, modules, helpers and mixins to existing Xeon's modules
#Where iz mawnn or gradul??/?/??/?
XDK is single-project and doesn't use any library, there will be also restricted acces to jdk so there is no need for any build toolor anything like that
